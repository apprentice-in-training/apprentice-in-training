# And Another Day Begins...

You know what they say.

The most brilliant idea won't ever come to life if you don't take the time and effort to hack it together.\
I like making stuff. But you can't make something good if you don't put in the effort. If there's one thing coding and being a computer science major has taught me, it's that sometimes you have to push through discomfort, such as painstakingly finding and isolating that bug.\
Sometimes, I have to tell myself to keep going. There's a half (or, more precisely, 7/8th) of me that wants to quit, and the other half that wants to keep going. I have to somehow use the 1/8th of me that wants to keep going to convince the 7/8th of me to chug along. It isn't always easy, but I think I should hold on to this hope that one day I will have the will to always keep going, like a superhero would. People can change. My tastes in art and music do, so why can't my motivation?\
There are plenty of other reasons for me to keep going. I believe everyone without exception can be guided to the path of virtuousness. People tell me I'm naive to believe that, but I think they're lazy for not. Is it that some people can't be changed, or that you don't want to put in the effort to try to change them? Everything takes effort.
Like hacking together large coding projects.\
Yeah, maybe I can start here. One line of code at a time.

## Beeps and Boops, Ones and Zeros

Generally, I make stuff that I think would be interesting to make.
- A full stack blog site. I'm not disclosing the link for the site on an account where you know my name. But trust that I made it.
  - People go on the web a lot, so making a project that people would actually see and immersing myself in the creation process behind something that I've seen before is pretty cool. I like learning about how the stuff I use daily works.
  - React, Node.js, Redux, GraphQL. I could have used REST but I decided to implement GraphQL instead for the backend.
- A matrix library: I took Linear Algebra and thought it was interesting.
  - I think my main motivation for making a full matrix library is the calculation of the determinants. When you calculate a determinant using cofactor expansion, you must calculate the determinant of a smaller submatrix, which lends itself to recursion. I know that this solution is an O(n!) solution and thus wildly inefficient, but the source code looks nice.
  - So, why not do the alternate way of calculating determinants, by using elementary row operations to get rid of the lower triangle and then multiplying the numbers on the diagonal? I can try this.
- Gacha pull simulator: Although I'm not a huge fan of gacha as a game mechanic, it makes for a fun little programming project.
  - The explanation for how gacha systems work will be in the source code once I commit the repository.

## The Mountain Ahead

Like is the case with anything, there's a lot I still need to learn about programming.
- I'm still not exactly sure what computing specialty I want to go into. Web dev? Cybersecurity? Game development? AI? What am I good at? What will I enjoy?
